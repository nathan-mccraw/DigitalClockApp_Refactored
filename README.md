### Summary:

This is a refactored verison of my first JavaScript project. My first verison, I incorporated any knowledge I had in C++, referenced JavaScript MDN documents, and completed this project in my first attempt at writing JavaScript syntax. This second verison incorporated input from my coach, Trevor Mearns, from the Software Development Mastermind Program. This refacor includes the use of multiple functions, ternary operators, and a more streamlined writeup.
